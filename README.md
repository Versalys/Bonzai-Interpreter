# Bonzai-Interpreter
Interpreter I'm making for a fun summer project (abandoned)

So this was my original crack at making an interpreter for a language that I created. This is evident in the expiriment as I did not use more tried and true ways of lexing and parsing, namely regrex and pushdown automata respectively.

What I did accomplish however was a way to parse many tokens, and process numerical expressions with the proper order of opperations. Given that this was entirely self designed, it is something that I am proud of.

This project has given me great insights, but at least at the time being there is no plan to continue the project.
